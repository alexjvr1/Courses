# R Session 2 - Data wrangling and visualisation


### Notes

This course is inspired by posts by David Robinson: http://varianceexplained.org/r/tidy-genomics/ 

and the DataCamp Introduction to TidyVerse course: https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-the-tidyverse



## Part 1: Data wrangling

Data never arrive in the condition that you need them in order to do effective data analysis. Data need to be re-shaped, re-arranged, and re-formatted, so that they can be visualized or be inputted into a machine learning algorithm. This module addresses the problem of wrangling your data so that you can bring them under control and analyze them effectively. The key goal in data wrangling is transforming non-tidy data into tidy data.

- Know how to clean data 

- Know how to change column names

- Know how to add and remove columns from data

### Troubleshooting

#### Common errors

The most common errors you'll run in to will be either 1) setting your path correctly, or 2) syntax errors in R. 

Have a look at this post for some common error messages and solutions: https://github.com/noamross/zero-dependency-problems/issues/7


#### Finding help

Forums like StackExchange are very helpful when troubleshooting errors. The trick is to learn how to phrase your search to find the correct answers. The more specific your search, the more likely you are to find helpful answers. 


### Commenting on your code and keeping notes

Remember to add comments to all your code as you go. Delete code that didn't work, and/or make a note of things that you might have done wrong and how to correct it. It could also be useful to add in links to the solution (e.g. a helpful StackExchange post you found).

Keeping a digital lab book (e.g. on GitHub) is good practice and helpful for storing your projects and code.
